The E-book was prepared and proofread by Veronica LeGrow with Katie
Nicholson, Erin Shea, David Baird, and David Skinner, all
undergraduates at Memorial University of Newfoundland, under the
direction of William Barker, and a compiled text was then prepared for
Gutenberg e-texts by Leon Kuperman.



This text includes ALL Grimm's fairy tales and 10
children's legends. The Margaret Hunt's translation is
very true to the German original.
